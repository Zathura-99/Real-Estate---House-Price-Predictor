# Real Estate - House Price Predictor
A machine learning project utilizing Python, scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy to predict house prices based on various features such as demographics, property size, neighborhood, and taxes. This project involves thorough data exploration, preprocessing, and model selection to deliver accurate price predictions.

## Project Workflow
- Loaded and explored data with descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand features and relationships.
- Used stratified shuffle split to maintain class distribution between train and test sets.
- Managed missing data using imputation techniques.
- Explored and applied feature scaling methods.
- Built a pipeline to automate data preprocessing.
- Trained and evaluated multiple models to select the best-performing one.
- Saved the trained model for future use using joblib.
